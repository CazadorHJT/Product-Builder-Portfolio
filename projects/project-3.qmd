## Overview

MCAT Prep App is a full-stack adaptive learning platform designed for pre-med students preparing for the MCAT. The app delivers mastery through active recall and error-driven reinforcement — not just passive content review.

The platform features a massive pre-generated question bank of **3,790 MCAT-style questions** spanning all 7 KAPLAN review books across 75 chapters. An adaptive learning algorithm tracks concept-level performance and reinforces weak areas by serving different questions on the same concept when a student answers incorrectly.

## Architecture

**Frontend:** React 19 + Vite

- Single-page application with Supabase JS SDK for direct database access
- Authentication via Supabase Auth (email/password, no email confirmation required)
- Interactive quiz interface with immediate feedback and detailed explanations
- Hierarchical progress dashboard (Book → Chapter → Concept) with color-coded mastery bars

**Backend:** Python FastAPI + Supabase PostgreSQL

- EPUB parsing pipeline (ebooklib + BeautifulSoup4) to extract content from 7 KAPLAN review books
- LLM-based question generation using Google Gemini for batch creation during development
- Database seeding scripts for populating books, chapters, and questions from JSON files
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies ensuring users can only access their own progress

## Technical Details

**Framework/Stack:** React, Vite, FastAPI, Python, Supabase

**Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS policies

**Auth:** Supabase Auth (sign up / sign in, JWT-based)

**AI:** Google Generative AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) for question generation

**Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Supabase cloud (database + auth)

**Tools Used:**

- Claude Code for development
- Supabase for backend infrastructure
- Vite for fast frontend builds

## How It Works

1. **Sign Up & Start** — Create an account and immediately begin studying with no email confirmation required.
2. **Select a Subject** — Browse the 7 MCAT subjects and choose a chapter or full book quiz.
3. **Adaptive Quizzing** — Answer 20 randomly sampled questions per session. Correct answers retire the question; incorrect answers pull in a new question on the same concept.
4. **Review & Learn** — After each answer, see a detailed explanation covering why the correct answer is right and why distractors are wrong.
5. **Track Mastery** — The progress dashboard shows color-coded mastery bars at every level, highlighting exactly where to focus next.
