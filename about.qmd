## Background

I'm a product-minded builder focused on the intersection of automotive engineering and software. My work centers on creating tools that make complex engine swap projects more accessible — combining AI-assisted planning, 3D scanning, and real-time collaboration into platforms that serve both hobbyists and professional builders.

### Education

- **B.S. Strategic Management, Product Management Emphasis** — Brigham Young University, Marriott School of Business

### Skills

**Technical**

- Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- Supabase (Auth, Storage, Realtime)
- C#, Unity 3D
- AI/LLM Integration (Claude API)
- REST API Design, Async Programming

**Product**

- Product requirements & roadmap definition
- User research & validation
- Cross-functional collaboration
- MVP scoping & iteration

**Domain**

- Engine swap fitment & compatibility
- Drivetrain & below-chassis systems
- Resto-mod planning & execution

### What's Next

I'm building **SwapSpec** — a software platform to assist in engine fitment for engine swaps with AI-assisted build planning. My long-term goal is to open a specialized resto-mod shop focused on engine swaps and below-chassis upgrades, backed by the software tools I'm building today.
